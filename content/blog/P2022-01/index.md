Hola!

I'm usually delighted to receive emails from people who visit my LinkedIn or website &  I'd love to hear from you if you wish to collaborate with me or any of the organizations that I am presently a part of. I'm also delighted to hear from you about any feedback or comments on my writing and (predominantly!) if you have uncovered any dead links somewhere on my website, which I would be glad to fix as soon as possible.

However, recently, I have been receiving emails and messages that coincide, and I can't reply to everyone with the same answers within a suitable time. So before reaching out to me with any queries, I would appreciate it if you could read through this FAQ!

### How did you get into Plaksha?

Honestly, I don’t know.

Even as an admitted student, I do not have access to information on how admissions work. I was admitted the same way as the rest of my class for that I completed my application and the requirements on the [Plaksha Admissions](https://plaksha.edu.in/admissions) website.

As for how to submit a successful application, I do not know what made my application successful. As for what was on my application, well, everything I am comfortable sharing about myself is on my website. Also, the application process at Plaksha is unique to the person applying, so my responses wouldn't help anyone.

### Can you help me with the College Application Process?

Sorry, I cannot, even though I would love to. As the application process, itself is unique to the applicant and ever-changing, I cannot do any better than redirect you to the institution’s websites or provide a few tips (which I have shared below). Hope you understand! 

For other Plaksha - Related Questions, you can still reach out to me via Email: [atharva] dot [sawant] at [plaksha] dot [edu] dot [in].

### Tips! (for College Application Process)

1. Be Yourself.
2. Start Early.
3. Relax & Enjoy the Process!

### How did you get an internship at MIT?

Once again, I don't know.

It was an unpredictable thing since I got the internship via a trial and error method called Cold Emailing. For those who are unfamiliar with Cold Emails:

> A cold email is an unsolicited e-mail that is sent to a receiver without prior contact. 

For me, I just randomly cold emailed various Professors of my interest at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and luckily, got a reply! Once again, this process is unexpected so don't be sad if you don't receive a reply. But it's worth a shot if you're fascinated by something!

# Website Specifications

### How did you make this website?
